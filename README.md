# Code-Examples
Examples of scripts I wrote for both professional and student work. All are written in C# for use with the Unity Engine.

While my experience with code is not directly related to data, analytics and modelling, I hope you find this interesting and unique!

Almost all scripts are from my VR development prototype for the University of Sydney. Here is a link to some brief info about that project: https://www.behance.net/gallery/91463757/VR-Design-and-Development 

I also included FireInteraction.cs as it's my most recent script, completed in my last semester for a student project. Instead of VR, it uses a Leap Motion for user interaction. Here's a link to the end result to help visualise what the code does: https://www.behance.net/gallery/91463219/Interactive-Product-Design

Additionally, here's a link to student work I did relating to Data Visualisation, more focused on working with visualising data sets using Excel and Adobe Illustrator than with code: https://www.behance.net/gallery/91462149/Data-Visualisation
